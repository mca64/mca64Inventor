// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:

// To sign your assembly, you must specify a key to use. Refer to the Microsoft .NET Framework documentation for more information on assembly signing.
// Use the attributes below to control which key is used for signing.
// Notes:
//   (*) If no key is specified, the assembly is not signed.
//   (*) KeyName refers to a key installed in the Crypto Service Provider (CSP) on your machine.
//   (*) KeyFile refers to a file containing a key.
//   (*) If the KeyFile and KeyName values are specified, the following occurs:
//       (1) If the KeyName can be found in the CSP, that key is used.
//       (2) If the KeyName does not exist and the KeyFile does exist, the key in the KeyFile is installed into the CSP and used.
//   (*) To create a KeyFile, use the sn.exe (Strong Name) utility.
//       When specifying the KeyFile, the location of the file should be relative to the project output directory, 
//       e.g., %Project Directory%\obj\<configuration>. If the KeyFile is in your project directory, 
//       use [assembly: AssemblyKeyFile("..\\..\\mykey.snk")]
//   (*) Delay Signing is an advanced option - see the .NET Framework documentation for more information.
